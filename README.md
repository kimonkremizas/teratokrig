# Teratokrig

Prototype of a 2D action RPG game made with Unity.

The title  *Teratokrig* means *monster war* and comes from the word *terata* (Greek for monsters) and *krig* (Danish for war).
Group project by me and Nicolai HÃ¶yer Christiansen, part of our 4th semester elective course in Game Development.
