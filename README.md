# Teratokrig

Prototype of a 2D action RPG game made with Unity.
The title  *Teratokrig* means *monster war* and comes from the word *terata* (greek for monsters) and *krig* (danish for war).
It was made by me and Nicolai HÃ¶yer Christiansen as part of our 4th semester elective course in Game Development.
